# Cell-type-specific individual network
This repository is designed to construct cell-type-specific individual networks based on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. These codes are used in the manuscript: Single-cell transcriptomic reveals network topology changes of cancer at the individual level.

# Organism
Homo sapiens

# Overall design
scRNA-seq data were obtained from the GEO database. Cell-type-specific networks were constructed using data from a single sample.

# Software and packages Information
All codes are run using R and the installation of RStudio is also recommended. The prerequisite packages are listed in the R scripts.
